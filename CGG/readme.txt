Four different versions of the sommth fuction namely smooth, smooth_numpy, smooth_numpy_alt, and smooth_alt have been written. While functions smooth_numpy and smooth_numpy_alt require NumPy python library, smooth and smooth_alt functions only rely on default python libraries. 

Among the four versions of the smooth function, execution times of smooth/smooth_alt functins appears to be significanly lower than the execution times of smooth_numpy or smooth_numpy_alt functions. 

While performances of smooth and smooth_alt functions are similar, smooth_alt has been chosen for the final version. 

The following scripts have been provided:
* smooth: smooth.py renamed to smooth_py.txt
* smooth_alternative: Contains alternative versions of the smooth function (including the final version). It is renamed to smooth_alternative_py.txt
* Smooth_Speed_Test: Contains a script to evaluate and compare the performances of the smooth functions provided in smooth_alternative script. It is renamed to Smooth_Speed_Test_py.txt
